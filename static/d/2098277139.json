To reach these levels you must buy it corresponding to your ETH which is gotten from the community for the respective upline.</p>\n<p>For example: If you want to upgrade from Level 1 to Level 2, you must purchase it by moving up your existing 0.2 ETH from the community to your 2nd upline. Make sure this happens in your backoffice and you always have help with your 2nd online wallet address. The time you buy each Level is always available for you to prepare.</p>\n<p>Rank is your rank, showing how you have a referral group below. Are you enthusiastic about helping people? There are 5 Ranks from: Rank 1, Rank 2, Rank 3, Rank 4, Rank 5 and you will be rewarded with the amount of Ethereum corresponding to each Rank you gain.</p>\n<p>For example, when you have 30 members in the sub 3rd branch, you will get Rank 2 and you will be rewarded with 0.3 ETH in your wallet. This is supported by the crypto Millionaire community.</p>"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Can I purchase beyond level?","tags":"how-a3"},"html":"<p>Is it possible when I am at Level 1 and I want to buy Level 5 too?
