There are no payments in the System, which means there can be no delays. Funds immediately go directly to the wallets of the participants.\nSee by yourself: balance of <a href=\"/\">the smart contract</a> is always 0 ETH.</p>"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Are there any risks here? If so, which ones?","tags":"risk-3"},"html":"<p>Everywhere on the site we write that there is NO RISK in the system. We mean by this that all money is transferred immediately to your wallet and stored on it. This means that there is NO RISK.\nHowever, it is worth considering that in the time interval between your registration and the registration of your first referral, a situation is created in which you have transferred to your upline 0.1 ETH, but have not yet received them back from your first referral.\nTherefore, technically the maximum theoretical risk is 0.1 ETH. These 0.1 ETH will be returned to you immediately fully from the first referral.</p>\n<p>Even if you specifically DIDN'T INVITE ANY SINGLE REFERRAL, sooner or later you will still receive referrals in the following ways without your participation: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>by overflow from your uplines, </li>\n<li>free referral from the System.\nTherefore, even this symbolic risk tends to 0.</li>\n</ol>"}]}}}
